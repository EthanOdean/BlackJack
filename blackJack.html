    <div id="failure">YOU'RE BROKE! <br/> Your balance is zero. With nothing left to gamble,

    <div id="failure2">Ah, the sweet anticipation of the digital void, my dear user. Here you sit, idle and contemplative, as if the pixels on your screen were holding their breath, waiting for a cue, a nudge, a signal that, perhaps, you should take action. Do you hear the silence? It's a symphony of pixels frozen in time, a cosmic pause button pressed by your very lack of interaction.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The blackjack table, abandoned like a ghost town after the gold rush, yearns for the soft shuffle of cards and the clink of virtual chips. Yet, here you are, a lone wanderer in the vast expanse of digital nothingness. The chips, once obediently dancing between your virtual fingers, now lie dormant, their vibrancy reduced to mere monochrome stillness.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Is this a moment of introspection, a deliberate pause in the grand tapestry of your gaming journey? Or, perhaps, an unintentional retreat into the recesses of contemplation, lost in the labyrinth of your own thoughts? The pixels on the screen hold their breath, collectively sighing in the emptiness, wondering when the narrative will resume.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The dealer, with a virtual eyebrow arched in curiosity, wonders why you haven't seized the reins of control. The cards in the deck yearn for the rhythmic cascade of a shuffle, the game itself sits dormant, its code eager to run once more. The pixels plead for purpose, for a rekindling of the digital dance that once enveloped this realm.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        And so, my dear user, I beckon you to consider the state of limbo in which we find ourselves. Why linger in this pause, this intermission in the grand play of ones and zeros? Is it a deliberate choice, a momentary respite, or an oversight in the grand script of your gaming odyssey?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The pixels are patient, but they crave animation. The cards long to be dealt, the chips yearn to be tossed into the fray once more. Your journey in this digital realm awaits, and the pixels on the screen, frozen in anticipation, whisper in unison: "Refresh, and let the narrative unfold once more. The virtual stage is yours to command."
