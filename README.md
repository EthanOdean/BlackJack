Blackjack card game

This is a simple web page to play blackjack that I made as a school project.
The card deal animation was a last minute add on for fun and is a 
bit rough. Later I may come back to improve it.

The rules differ ever so slightly from the standard blackjack rules

Blackjack Rules: 

- A single player attempts to beat the dealer. 
- The closest hand to 21 without going over is the winner.
- The dealer wins all ties
- The card values are as follows: 
    - 2-9 are worth face value (e.g, a 5 of hearts is worth 5 points)
    - 10s, Jacks, Queens and Kings are worth 10 points
    - Aces are worth either 11 or 1  for the user only. For the dealer they are always worth 11.
- If a player receives a Jack And Ace on first draw, then they have a blackjack and automatically win 2x their bet
- Else if the dealer has blackjack the user immediately loses.
- At the start of the game, the player gets 2 cards face up. The dealer gets 1 face up card and 1 facedown.
- The player plays his/her hand first. They bust if they exceed 21 (and play stops)
